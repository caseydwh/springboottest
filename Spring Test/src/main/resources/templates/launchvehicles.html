                            <p>The Saturn IB (pronounced "Saturn one bee", also known as the uprated Saturn I) was an 
                                American launch vehicle commissioned by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
                                (NASA) for the Apollo program. It replaced the S-IV second stage of the Saturn I with the 
                                much more powerful S-IVB, able to launch a partially fueled Apollo command and service module 
                                (CSM) or a fully fueled Apollo Lunar Module (LM) into low Earth orbit for early flight tests 
                                before the larger Saturn V needed for lunar flight was ready. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_IB">[1]</a>

                            <h5>Soviet Launch Vehicles - Soyuz-U</h5>
                            <p>The Soyuz-U launch vehicle was an improved version of the original Soyuz rocket. Soyuz-U was part of 
                                the R-7 family of rockets based on the R-7 Semyorka missile. Members of this rocket family were 
                                designed by the TsSKB design bureau and constructed at the Progress factory in Samara, Russia (now 
                                a united company, TsSKB-Progress). The first Soyuz-U flight took place on 18 May 1973, carrying as 
                                its payload Kosmos 559, a Zenit military surveillance satellite.[6] The final flight of a Soyuz-U 
                                rocket took place on 22 February 2017, carrying Progress MS-05 to the International Space Station. 
                                Soyuz-U was in use continuously for almost 44 years. Production of R-7 derived launch vehicles 
                                peaked in the late 1970s-early 1980s at 55â€“60 a year. Soyuz-U held the world record of highest 
                                launch rate in a year in 1979 with 47 flights. Over its operational lifetime, the Soyuz-U variant 
                                flew a total of 786 missions, another world record. Soyuz-U has also been one of the most reliable 
                                launchers, with a success rate of 97.3%.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz-U">[2]</a>
